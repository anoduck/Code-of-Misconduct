## Code of Misconduct

### Intro

The code of misconduct is a response to a pattern of behavior found within the Code of Conduct found in the
modern day code repository. This document has strayed far from its original intended purpose and humble
origin. Historically the code of conduct applied only to development team members, or contributors. It
was primarily interested in maintaining cohesiveness of behavior within the development community, and 
establish patterns of acceptable intercommunication between team members. This stands at contrast to the 
modern interpretation, which applies to anyone who uses the code, developers and regular end users alike. It
attempts to establish a social contract with users binding them to a set of ethical values that the user must 
obey or risk public shuning/shaming if not perscribed to. This set of ethical values are not universally held,
but rather are political precepts, thus by establishing a social contract enforces a set of ideals
that the user may or may not ascribe to. Naturally, leading to a reduction in diversity of thought, and
suppression of differing viewpoints. By limiting the availability of options in one's mind, thought itself
becomes constrained to the detriment innovation, and barriers to the accessibility of technology are soundly
established.

The Open Source technological movement is found upon the reduction or demolishion of barriers preventing
accessibility of computational technology for the embetterment of computer science. It was the intent for the
Code of Conduct to encourage and foster this free exchange of ideas and diversify thought, not stiffle it.
Thus in order maintain our own liberties as diverse individuals, we must establish a code of misconduct, to
reinforce our own individuality and excercise freedom of the mental faculties.

#### Proposal

Here lay the first proposal for a tentative outline for a code of misconduct. It shall be recognized as a work
of progress until peace is found and agreement is made it sufficiently establishes:
1. The freedom needed for an uninhibited and unrestrained exchange of ideas and concepts within the mind of the user.
2. Enables the exchange of these ideas and concepts via the freedom of speech.
